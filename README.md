Developer notes
---------------

 * Tag meetups when they're done (`git tag meetup-009`)
 * Write one-off documents in _posts
 * See http://manilajs.com/posts

On Facebook images:

 * Place them in `images/___/share/` (where the blank is the meetup ID)
 * Update `index.md` to add those URLs
 * Yes, we should have many. Facebook's limit is 4 though
 * Ping Facebook on updates ([debug](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmanilajs.com))
 * When posting to Facebook, you'll then be able to change images from within FB

Markup reference
----------------

TODO actually make this:-

* .pull-quote-heading
* .pull-quote
* .sans-pull-quote
